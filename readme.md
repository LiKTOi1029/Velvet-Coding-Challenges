# Velvet Coding Challenges

## What Is Velvet?

Velvet is a bytecode virtual machine developed by [VoidWyrm-2](https://github.com/voidwyrm-2) made
in the Go programming language. You can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/voidwyrm-2/velvet-vm)

## What Is This Repository?

This is the repository I will be using to post all of my coding challenges that I will be writing in this bytecode 
vm. I will be posting here semi-regularly. My lua repo will be prioritized as most of my current projects are unfinished
right [here](https://github.com/liktoi1029/coding-challenges-folder) This repository will be staged identically to my
lua coding challenges repository.

## Why Velvet?

Because Velvet is the first bytecode vm I have ever been exposed to (would you believe me if I told you I have been
coding for almost a decade now and just recently got exposed to bytecode?)\
\
I didn't want to half-heart it. And this repository was born.
