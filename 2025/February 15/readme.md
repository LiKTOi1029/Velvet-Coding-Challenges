# The Collatz Conjecture

The collatz conjecture is an unsolved mathematical problem where it is theorized that you can
take any real number (all real numbers may as well be infinite) and if it is even, divide it by 2
and if it is odd multiply by 3 and add 1. This is theorized to always result in 1 by the end of the 
algorithm
